FOSS - Embedded Developemt Eviroment

The idea is to create an Integrated Development Enviroment 
for Arduino developeers and other *duino family, 
as well as relatives; and make them all happy together ;-)

That is across platform and board's in the FOSS arena.

To achieve this, some stuff in this repsoitiry is replicated/pulled (still working on)

/bin - contains all the binary executables, shell scripts etc
/cppqt-ide - the c++ enviroment GUI * placeholder
/dawnedeonline - The Online Google app engine, shared shippeets and global distribution
/etc - supeerfulous stuff
/examples - examples of code
/hardware - all the hardware spes and their requuirements
/help_docs - the api documentation and tutorials
/libs - all the header files, c+code
/pyqt-ide - A Qt front end in python
/pygtk-ide - under development - see nick
