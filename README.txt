FOSS - Embedded Developemt Eviroment

The idea is to create an Integrated Development Enviroment 
for Arduino developers and other *duino family members and
cousins, relatives, and make them all happy together ;-)

To achieve this, some stuff in this repsoitiry is replicated/pulled (still working on)

/bin           - contains all the binary executables, shell scripts etc
/cppqt-ide     - the c++ enviroment GUI * placeholder
/dawnedeonline - google cloud and global distribution
/etc           - configuration
/examples      - examples of code snippets etc
/hardware      - all the hardware specs/hex etc
/help_docs     - the api documentation and tutorials
/libs          - all the header files, c+code, etc
/pyqt-ide      - A Qt front end in python ** Under active development **
