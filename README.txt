EDE


The idea is to create an Integrated enviroment, that is across platform and board's in the FOSS arena.

One of the MAIN issues is the requirements of libs and whether supported.

We hope that this project as a job level can push and pull with all the others 
to create a koool, enjoyable and steady enviroment :-)

To achieve this, some studd in this repsoitiry is replicated/pulled (still working on)

/bin - contains all the binary executables, shell scripts etc
/cppqt-ide - the c++ enviroment GUI
/dawnedeonline - The Online Google app engine, shared shippeets and global distribution
/etc - supeerfulous stuff
/examples - examples of code
/hardware - all the hardware spes and their requuirements
/help_docs - the api documentation and tutorials
/libs - all the header files, c+code
/pyqt-ide - A Qt front end in python
